# ToDo List with jQuery

### What is this about?

This ToDo List was build as a mini project for Achievement 1 in [Career Foundry's Full-Stack Web Development Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/). <br>
It is a (responsive) web application where a user can add items, cross out items, delete items, change order of items via drag and drop. <br>

### How to add Sass

- via command line, unless you already have it, run `npm install -g scss`
  - see more info here: [install Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)
- on Visual Studio Code, install "Live Sass Compiler" extension, this will add a functionality you can comfortably reach via click on "Watch Sass": <br>

  - this will run a watcher in your terminal, and will compile everything you do in your `styles.scss` into a `styles.css`
  - you can now work with your `style.scss`
